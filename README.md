### Planning a project

When planning a project, you should be able to answer the following questions:

1. What is my application?
2. Who is the audience to this application?
3. What data do I need in this application?
4. What endpoints does my application need?
5. What should my application look like(display)?

Planning is extremely important. If you plan well, you will spend less time on fixing unexpected bugs in your code, and less time trying to figure things out on the fly.

### Packages you may need

* Axios - npm i axios
* Express - npm i express
